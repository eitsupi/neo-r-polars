\arguments{
\item{path}{A character. File path to which the file should be written.}

\item{...}{Dots which should be empty.}

\item{include_bom}{Logical, whether to include UTF-8 BOM in the CSV output.}

\item{include_header}{Logical, hether to include header in the CSV output.}

\item{separator}{Separate CSV fields with this symbol.}

\item{line_terminator}{String used to end each row.}

\item{quote_char}{Byte to use as quoting character.}

\item{batch_size}{Number of rows that will be processed per thread.}

\item{datetime_format}{A format string, with the specifiers defined by the
\href{https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html}{chrono}
Rust crate. If no format specified, the default fractional-second precision
is inferred from the maximum timeunit found in the frameâ€™s Datetime cols (if
any).}

\item{date_format}{A format string, with the specifiers defined by the
\href{https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html}{chrono}
Rust crate.}

\item{time_format}{A format string, with the specifiers defined by the
\href{https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html}{chrono}
Rust crate.}

\item{float_precision}{Whether to use scientific form always (\code{TRUE}), never
(\code{FALSE}), or automatically (\code{NULL}) for Float32 and Float64 datatypes.}

\item{null_value}{A string representing null values (defaulting to the empty
string).}

\item{quote_style}{Determines the quoting strategy used. Must be one of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"necessary"} (default): This puts quotes around fields only when
necessary. They are necessary when fields contain a quote, delimiter or
record terminator. Quotes are also necessary when writing an empty record
(which is indistinguishable from a record with one empty field). This is
the default.
\item \code{"always"}: This puts quotes around every field. Always.
\item \code{"never"}: This never puts quotes around fields, even if that results in
invalid CSV data (e.g.: by not quoting strings containing the separator).
\item \code{"non_numeric"}: This puts quotes around all fields that are non-numeric.
Namely, when writing a field that does not parse as a valid float or
integer, then quotes will be used even if they aren`t strictly necessary.
}}

\item{maintain_order}{Maintain the order in which data is processed. Setting
this to \code{FALSE} will be slightly faster.}

\item{type_coercion}{Logical. Coerce types such that operations succeed and
run on minimal required memory.}

\item{predicate_pushdown}{Logical. Applies filters as early as possible at
scan level.}

\item{projection_pushdown}{Logical. Select only the columns that are needed
at the scan level.}

\item{simplify_expression}{Logical. Various optimizations, such as constant
folding and replacing expensive operations with faster alternatives.}

\item{slice_pushdown}{Logical. Only load the required slice from the scan
level. Don't materialize sliced outputs (e.g. \code{join$head(10)}).}

This allows streaming results that are larger than RAM to be written to disk.
