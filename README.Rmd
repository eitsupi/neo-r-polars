# Rewrite of [r-polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/r-polars)

## Motivation

I have been developing r-polars for over a year, and I felt that a significant rewrite was necessary.
r-polars is a clone of [py-polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/tree/main/py-polars),
but the package structure is currently quite different.
Therefore, it was difficult to keep up with frequent updates.

I thought that now, around the release of Python Polars 1.0.0, is a good time for a complete rewrite, so I decided to try it.

There are several reasons to rewrite r-polars on both the Rust and R sides.

### Rust side

1. Appropriate file division. Due to the limitations of [extendr](https://github.com/extendr/extendr),
   it is not possible to place multiple impl blocks.
   ([extendr/extendr#538](https://github.com/extendr/extendr/issues/538))
2. Error handling.
   There is a lot of custom code to use the Result type with extendr, which is quite different from other packages based on extendr.
   ([extendr/extendr#650](https://github.com/extendr/extendr/issues/650))
3. Simplify type conversion.
   The code is difficult to follow because it uses a macro called `robj_to` for type conversion (at least in rust-analyzer).

About 1 and 2, I expect that switching from extendr to [savvy](https://github.com/yutannihilation/savvy)
will improve the situation.

For 3, in py-polars and nodejs-polars, a thin `Wrap` struct wraps other types and processes them with standard `From` traits etc.,
which I think makes the code cleaner.

### R side

1. The structure of classes.
   In py-polars, the strategy is that classes defined on the Rust side (e.g., `PyDataFrame`) are wrapped by classes defined on the Python side (e.g., `DataFrame`).
   In r-polars, a complex strategy is adopted to update classes created by Rust side/extendr (e.g., `RPolarsDataFrame`) with a lot of custom code.
   (This is also related to the fact that extendr makes associated functions of Rust structs members of R classes. savvy does not mix associated functions and methods.)
2. S3 methods first.
   This is also related to the Rust side, in the current r-polars, generic functions like `as_polars_series` were added later,
   so there are several places where type conversion from R to Polars is done on the Rust side, making it difficult to understand where the type conversion is done.
   If type conversion from R to Polars is done with two generic functions, `as_polars_series` and `as_polars_expr`, the code will be much simpler and customization from the R side will be possible.
3. Error handling.
   Currently, r-polars has its own Result type on the R side, and error handling is done through it.
   The backtrace generated that is quite easy to understand, but it is not necessarily easy to use when using polars internally in other packages, such as `testthat::expect_error()`.
4. Based on `rlang`.
   Currently, r-polars has no R package dependencies. This is great,
   but that includes [a degraded copy of `list2()`](https://github.com/pola-rs/r-polars/blob/6eac27a0766d2b6ca92a72c1c7fa76eaeb58bb98/R/dotdotdot.R#L1-L20)
   instead of the convenient functions in the `rlang` package.
   `rlang` is a lightweight R package, and I feel that it is more beneficial to depend on the convenient functions of `rlang` than to stick to no dependencies.

1 and 3 are also related to the fact that it is built with extendr, and it seems that switching to savvy is appropriate here as well.
If we abandon the current Result type on the R side, it is natural to use `rlang` for error handling, so from that perspective, it is reasonable to depend on `rlang` in 4.

### Current Status

The directory structure on the Rust side is a complete copy of py-polars.
The structure of R classes is also the same as py-polars.

The basic classes such as `DataFrame`, `Series`, `Expr`, and `LazyFrame` have been implemented,
and some functions work correctly.

```{r}
df = pl$DataFrame(
  A = 1:5,
  fruits = c("banana", "banana", "apple", "apple", "banana"),
  B = 5:1,
  cars = c("beetle", "audi", "beetle", "beetle", "beetle"),
)

df$sort("fruits")$select(
  "fruits",
  "cars",
  pl$lit("fruits")$alias("literal_string_fruits"),
  pl$col("B")$filter(pl$col("cars") == "beetle")$sum(),
  pl$col("A")$filter(pl$col("B") > 2)$sum()$over("cars")$alias("sum_A_by_cars"),
  pl$col("A")$sum()$over("fruits")$alias("sum_A_by_fruits"),
  pl$col("A")$reverse()$over("fruits")$alias("rev_A_by_fruits"),
  pl$col("A")$sort_by("B")$over("fruits")$alias("sort_A_by_B_by_fruits"),
)
```

Errors is displayed in a way that is not as bad. (Thanks, @etiennebacher)

```{r}
#| error: true
# Error from the Rust side
pl$DataFrame(a = "a")$cast(a = pl$Int8)
```

```{r}
#| error: true
# Error from the R side
pl$DataFrame(a = "a")$cast(a = integer)
```

The functionality to dispatch the methods of `Expr` to `Series` has also been implemented.

```{r}
s <- as_polars_series(mtcars)

s$struct$field |>
   body()

s$struct$field("am")
```

Due to the changes in the package structure, it is now possible to add namespaces, which was not possible with the current r-polars.

```{r}
math_shortcuts <- function(s) {
  # Create a new environment to store the methods
  self <- new.env(parent = emptyenv())

  # Store the series
  self$`_s` <- s

  # Add methods
  self$square <- function() self$`_s` * self$`_s`
  self$cube <- function() self$`_s` * self$`_s` * self$`_s`

  # Set the class
  class(self) <- c("polars_namespace_series", "polars_object")

  # Return the environment
  self
}

pl$api$register_series_namespace("math", math_shortcuts)

s <- as_polars_series(c(1.5, 31, 42, 64.5))
s$math$square()$rename("s^2")
```

### Disadvantages

Due to the changes in the R class structure, the methods are now dynamically added by a loop each time an R class is built.
So I'm worried that the performance will degrade after a large number of methods are available.
However, it is difficult to compare this at the moment.

### Next Steps

I would like to check if it is possible to implement a process like `map_elements` that calls the R from the Rust side.
